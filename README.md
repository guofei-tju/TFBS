# TFBS1
In this paper, we analyze high-resolution DNA-binding profiles and motifs for TFs, covering all possible contiguous 8-mers. First, we divide all 8-mers motifs into 16 various categories, and select all sorts of samples from each category by setting the threshold of E-score. Then, we employ five feature representation methods. Also, we adopt a total of three feature selection methods to filter out useless features. Finally, we use Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) as the base classifier, and adopt the one-vs-rest strategy to construct 16 binary classifiers to solve this multi-classification problem. In the experiment, our method achieves the best performance with the over- all Acc of 79.72% and the MCC of 0.77. We find the similarity relationship among each category from different TF families and obtain sequence motif schematic dia- gram via multiple sequence alignment. The complexity of DNA recognition may act as an important role in the evolution of gene regulatory.
